This is the project from Udacity Machine Learning Nanodegree: P0: Titanic Survival Exploration.

P0: Titanic Survival Exploration

In this optional project, you will create decision functions that attempt to predict survival outcomes from the 1912 Titanic disaster based on each passengerâ€™s features, such as sex and age. You will start with a simple algorithm and increase its complexity until you are able to accurately predict the outcomes for at least 80% of the passengers in the provided data. This project will introduce you to some of the concepts of machine learning as you start the Nanodegree program.
