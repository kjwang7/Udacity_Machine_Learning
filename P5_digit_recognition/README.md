P5: Build a Digit Recognition Program

In this project, you will use what you've learned about deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks to create a live camera application or program that prints numbers it observes in real time from images it is given. First, you will design and test a model architecture that can identify sequences of digits in an image. Next, you will train that model so it can decode sequences of digits from natural images by using the Street View House Numbers (SVHN) dataset. After the model is properly trained, you will then test your model using a live camera application (optional) or program on newly-captured images. Finally, once you obtain meaningful results, you will refine your implementation to also localize where numbers are on the image, and test this localization on newly-captured images.
